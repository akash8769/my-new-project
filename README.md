# Summary<br />
This project aims to develop an AI-driven smart drone system that revolutionizes agriculture and security surveillance. The drone will use computer vision, deep learning, and IoT to analyze crop health, detect diseases, monitor water levels, and estimate yields for farmers. Additionally, it will enhance security by detecting suspicious activities, monitoring borders, and tracking intrusions in real time. Equipped with high-resolution cameras, sensors, and AI algorithms, this drone system will provide real-time insights to farmers, security agencies, and businesses, reducing manual effort, improving efficiency, and boosting productivity.Building AI course project

##Background
             Several challenges exist in agriculture and security:
             Agriculture: Farmers lack accurate data on crop diseases, water levels, and yield estimation.
             Security: Manual surveillance of large areas is expensive and limited.
             Solution: A smart drone system that provides AI-based insights to farmers and security agencies.

##How is it used?
  In Agriculture:
             The drone captures images and sensor data from fields.
              AI models process this data to identify crop health, moisture levels, and diseases.
              Farmers receive insights via a mobile app.
  In Security:
              The drone monitors crowded areas and borders.
              AI detects suspicious activities and sends alerts.

##Data sources and AI methods
   Data sources:
              Satellite data from NASA and agricultural institutions.
              Live camera and sensor data from drones.
              Crime data from law enforcement agencies.
  AI techniques:
            Computer Vision: For crop disease detection and suspicious activity identification.
            Deep Learning: For image classification and pattern recognition.
            IoT and Cloud Computing: To process drone data and send real-time alerts.

##Challenges
            Limited drone battery life.
            Possibility of inaccurate predictions due to poor data.
            Legal and privacy concerns regarding surveillance.

#What next?
I         integration of high-resolution sensors and improved AI algorithms.
          Development of a user-friendly app for farmers and security personnel.
          Enhancing the drone system for full autonomy.
